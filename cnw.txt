http://www.surveyskitchen.com/: 	SurveysKitchen is full-stack online surveying tool. This is my own project and is being developed mostly for fun. It's based on Rails 3.2 + Mysql.

Running in the cloud (Rackspace). Foundation's grid system (foundation.zurb.com) was used while building html. RailsAdmin as an admin interface.
